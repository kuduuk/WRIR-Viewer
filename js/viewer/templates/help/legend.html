    The <b>Legend Widget</b> shows a list of the map symbols 
    for each operational layer that is visible on the map.  
    The legend is dynamic; its contents update automatically 
    as operational layers are turned on and off from the 
    <b>Table of Contents Widget</b> or as the map scale 
    changes.  When no operational layers are visible, it 
    displays "No Legend."

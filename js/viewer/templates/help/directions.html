    The <b>Directions Widget</b> provides turn-by-turn
    driving directions between two or more locations.<br>
    <br>
    A location is defined by entering an address, place 
    name, county, zip code, FIPS code, etc.<br>
    <br>
    Clicking on a turn instruction of the directions will 
    cause the map to center on that location and display
    a dialog containing the turn instruction.<br>
    <br>
    Directions can also be printed.<br>
